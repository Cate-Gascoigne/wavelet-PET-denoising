# wavelet-PET-denoising

This repository contains source code for enhancing `low-dose PET` (positron-emission-tomography) images 
using `3D-UNet` model on `wavelet` domain. Project initialized by ultra-low-dose PET
[Grand Challenge](https://ultra-low-dose-pet.grand-challenge.org/), and all clinical PET data are collected from the 
grand-challenge platform.
